Description: Sugar wrapper around the Squeak Etoys programming language
 Sugar is a desktop environment. It is conceived as a platform upon
 which children learn with Sugar Activities. The platform provides
 mechanisms for collaboration, reflection, and exploration. Sugar
 Activities cover a broad range of applications: browsing, drawing,
 composing, writing, programming, etc.
 .
 Squeak Etoys was inspired by LOGO, PARC-Smalltalk, Hypercard, and
 starLOGO. It is a media-rich authoring environment with a simple,
 powerful scripted object model for many kinds of objects created by
 end-users. It includes 2D and 3D graphics, images, text, particles,
 presentations, web-pages, videos, sound and MIDI, etc. It includes the
 ability to share desktops with other Etoy users in real-time, so many
 forms of immersive mentoring and play can be done over the Internet.
 .
 The Etoys activity embeds Squeak Etoys into Sugar.
