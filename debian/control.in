Description: Sugar wrapper around the Squeak Etoys programming language
 Sugar is a graphical user interface aimed at children.
 .
 Originating as integral part of the OLPC "XO" a.k.a. the $100 laptop,
 Sugar has since grown into a more widely usable low-ressource desktop
 environment for kids. 
 .
 This package contains the Etoys activity.
 . 
 Etoys is an educational tool for teaching children ideas in compelling
 ways. It features a media-rich authoring environment and visual 
 programming system.
