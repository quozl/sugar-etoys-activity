sugar-etoys-activity (116-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Simplify setting main branch.
  * Drop lintian override: lintian is wrong to expect package
    dependencies being explicitly declared in control file.
  * Modernize long description, based on upstream wiki phrases.
  * Stop removing license file from binary package: Let CDBS replace
    with symlink instead.
